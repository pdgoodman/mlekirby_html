			<h4>Women in the U.S. are grossly under-represented in political power positions at the national, state, and local level.  Despite this under-representation, female voter turnout has exceeded male turnout in every presidential election since 1980.  Young women in particular are exercising their voting rights at an increasingly higher rate than men.  As we look to November's election, unmarried women are considered a fast-growing and under-represented demographic.</h4>

			<h2>2012 Survey on Women in Politics</h2>
			</div>
		<div class="grid_9">		
			<h4>For my master's thesis, I explored the issue of marital status and measured female voters' perceptions toward female candidates who were either single or married with children. The purpose of my research was to understand the attitudes and opinions of female voters as a way to ultimately understand what it will take for female candidates to be successful. Past research on this topic provided inconclusive evidence for whether or not disclosing a female candidate's marital status helps or hurts her campaign, the extent of gender bias in media coverage, and what motivates female voters to support female candidates. What is the most compelling reason for deciding to vote for one woman over another? What is the best way for a female candidate to explain her marital status to female voters? How can that message be shaped and filtered through the media in a way that garners positive campaign coverage? To answer some of these questions, I conducted an online survey of 529 female voters between 18 and 29 years old. The findings from my research are discussed below.</h4>

		<h2>Key Findings</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="grid_12"><!-- individual finding -->
		<h2>1. Female voters were more likely to feel positively toward the candidate who shared their marital status.</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="grid_8">
		<h4>When asked to rate each candidate on six character-based qualities of a leader, the results found that the single group felt more positively toward the single candidate and the married group felt more positively toward the married candidate. The single candidate received higher mean scores from the single group than the married group on all six qualities. These findings suggested that the young single female voters perceived the single candidate to be fully capable of being president, regardless of the fact that she has never been married and does not have children. Furthermore, married voters found the married candidate to be significantly more understanding of them than the single candidate. This finding was a strong indication that young married female voters felt positively toward the married candidate because they were able to relate to her as a woman with children.</h4>

		<h2>2. Female voters were more likely to feel positively toward the candidate who shared their marital status.</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="grid_8">
		<h4>When asked which candidate - the single candidate or married candidate with children - the respondents would be more likely to vote for, the single group preferred the single candidate and the married group preferred the married candidate. The most interesting finding, however, was that the single group was much more enthusiastic in their support for the single candidate than the married group was for the married candidate. The married group supported the married candidate by a 6-point margin, while the single group supported the single candidate by a 32-point margin.</h4>

		<h2>3. Marital status does not hinder female candidacy, but having children was seen as a potential time-management liability.</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="grid_8">
		<h4>In general, both candidates were well liked, seen as qualified, trustworthy, effective, tough decision-makers, understanding, and strong leaders. Even though female candidates are more likely to receive support from female voters who share their marital statuses, both the single candidate and the married candidate received crossover support. The only quality that clearly separated the two candidates was the issue of having enough time to devote to political office; respondents were far more confident that the candidate without children would have more time to fulfill the duties of the presidency.</h4>

	<h4>Need a blurb to the effect of, "the findings of this research only represent the 529 women who took this survey. This information cannot be generalized to a greater population.  Additional research using a probability-based sample is necessary to determine whether or not these findings have external validity."</h4>
